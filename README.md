# My C/Embedded laboratory works for university
Throughout the passing of the course, I was using [STM32F411E-DISCO](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f411ediscovery.html) board and Saleae Logic Analyzer. 

Recomended software: STM32CubeIDE and Saneae Logic 2
## Lab 1
The task was to make 4 LEDs blink in some synchronous way.
## Lab 2
The task was to make LEDs change their blinking pattern with reset button. 4 patterns were included.
## Lab 3
The task was to make each LED glow with certain frequency.
## Lab 4
This task included implementing interaction with potentiometer. By increasing voltage on potentiometer, you increase the number of LEDs glowing and vice versa.
## Lab 6
The task was to write a simple song and play it through the headphones socket.
